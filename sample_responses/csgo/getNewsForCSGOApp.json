In <a href=\"https://www.ence.gg/article/ence-suspends-head-coach-slaava-twista-raesaenen\">a statement,</a> ENCE clarifies that Twista has not yet been proven guilty by ESIC, but that it has started an investigation into the coach. While Twista could have stayed on as ENCE's coach, the organisation decided to suspend him anyway in the interest of competitive integrity.</p>\n<p>\"During our consultation, ESIC stated that we are allowed to let Twista act as a coach through the investigation period, but we have decided to suspend him regardless,\" the statement reads. \"While Twista has done a stellar job coaching the team at ENCE and we have no reason to believe he has had any foul play during his time with us, we take competitive integrity very seriously. Suspending him to conclude the investigation was the only course of action we saw to be right.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/ence-coach-suspended-bug\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/cloud9-alex-signing\">Cloud9 signs CS:GO star ALEX in $1.65 million deal</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/coach-bug-valve-rmr-reset\">CS:GO teams found to have used coach bug will have RMR points reset</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/rio-major-2020-cancelled\">The Rio CS:GO Major has finally been cancelled</a></p>\n",

In levels of transparency rarely seen in the esports industry, HenryG openly revealed some of the details of ALEX's signing, confirming the Brit has penned a three year deal worth $1.65 million. This comes after HenryG promised to be as open as possible about Cloud9's business in forming its new team.</p>\n<p>While ALEX officially departed Vitality less than 24 hours ago, he has not played for the organisation for over six months after <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/teams/team-vitality/alex-csgo-leaving-rumours\">stepping down from the main roster,</a> citing burnout and exhaustion over Vitality's packed travel schedule.
