Anti-cheating bots have been created to police the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters\">FPS game</a>, working against any players that enter a round and break the rules.</p>\n<p>The \"cheater teminators\", as they've been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googleygareth/status/1301599497852784642?s=21\">dubbed on Twitter</a>, are bots that enter any given match of the multiplayer game to target anyone whose behaviour seems strange. Known in-game as Bot Extermination Services, they're AI programmed with cheating powers, drawn to any other players that use the same untoward abilities, and start killing them. A crude system, sure, but modern problems require modern solutions.</p>\n<p>Where these bots originate from appears unknown - one <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/imf5bi/the_tf2_community_has_created_bots_that_will_not/\">Reddit user</a> speculates they're from LmaoBox, a Team Fortress 2 cheats seller protecting its investment by making sure there isn't a mass exodus due to too many cheaters. Selling cheats, then anonymously supplying the anti-cheat protection, would be a very clever, deeply capitalist, massively gross business model. As it stands, players in the community seem glad they exist all the same, with floods of memes about the game becoming a war of bots against bots.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/bots-anti-cheat\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/mod-classic\">Remember Team Fortress 2 in 2008?
